#Reading Notes Class 209

- Why are forms so important in web development? Web forms are a very powerful tool for interacting with users â€” most commonly they are used for collecting data from users, or allowing them to control a user interface.
- When designing a form, what are some key things to keep in mind when it comes to user experience? You want to be simple and straightforward, use one column,arrange your form fields from easiest to hardest, use inline form field validation, align text to the left and clearly title your form.
- List 5 form elements and explain their importance.

- How would you describe events to a non-technical friend? Events are things that occur inside a project you are working on. Think of them like when you go to open up a video game of a computer. The action of double clicking on the game icon is what an event would be. Because you double clicked on the game icon is created an event that told the computer to then open up said game.
- When using the addEventListener() method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide?
- Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful? target is a property of an event object that refers to the element that triggered the event. This can be useful for identifying which element an event originated from, which is often necessary when working with event listeners.
- What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing? Capturing phase : the event moves down towards the element. Target phase: the event reaches the target element. Bubbling phase: the event bubbles up from the element.
