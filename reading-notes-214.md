# Pstcohological Safety

- What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams? Communication, understanding and acceptance are three majoy facorts that can help a team be more safe, successful, and allow for a space where people can be the best versions of themselves within the company.
- Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety. 
    Playing a professional sport is a really high stress environment when you are bringing in the factor that people are trying to make a living, but due to the nature of the sport there is no guarantee that you are going to be around for the whole year let alone your career. You can either be cut or traded. 
   I wouldn't say that it was an unsafe place to work nor would I say it brought out the bad sides of people, but more that it required you to have to manage your stress and both your mental and physical well being. A lot of life happens in the top two inches as we put it in the sports world.
- What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members? It is a massive positive impact, not just from the standpoint of production success but also the environment that it creates in order for people to feel like they can succeed or if they are having issues or hurdles they can overcome themselves, they have that support system around them that can help with these challenges.
