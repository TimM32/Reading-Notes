# Reading Notes Class 04


- To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element? We wrap it inside of the < a > < /a >.
- The href attribute contains what information? This contains the web address that you are linking to your HTML webpage
- What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?
  Screen reader users like jumping around from link to link on the page, and reading links out of context.
Search engines use link text to index target files, so it is a good idea to include keywords in your link text to effectively describe what is being linked to.
Visual readers skim over the page rather than reading every word, and their eyes will be drawn to page features that stand out, like links. They will find descriptive link text useful. 
  Don't repeat the URL as part of the link text — URLs look ugly, and sound even uglier when a screen reader reads them out letter by letter.
Don't say "link" or "links to" in the link text — it's just noise. Screen readers tell people there's a link. Visual users will also know there's a link, because links are generally styled in a different color and underlined (this convention generally shouldn't be broken, as users are used to it).
Keep your link text as short as possible — this is helpful because screen readers need to interpret the entire link text.
Minimize instances where multiple copies of the same text are linked to different places. This can cause problems for screen reader users, if there's a list of links out of context that are labeled "click here", "click here", "click here".

- What is meant by “normal flow”? Elements on webpages lay themselves out according to normal flow - until we do something to change that. This article explains the basics of normal flow as a grounding for learning how to change it.
- What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements? block level or flex level is a one-dimensional layout method for laying out items in rows or columns. Items flex to fill additional space and shrink to fit into smaller spaces

- Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element. Well since it sits on its won document you can style it sperately from all the other aspects fo the page. Everything that is connected to that absolue postion will be affect only when you change that specific document.
- What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning? Absolutely positioned elements are positioned with respect to a containing block, which is the nearest postioned ancestor. If there is no positioned ancestor, the viewport will be the containing block. Elements with fixed positioning are fixed with respect to the viewport—the viewport is always their containing block.

- Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation. The main difference between a function expression and a function declaration is the function name, which can be omitted in function expressions to create anonymous functions.
- What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
  Parameters allows us to give things in our code human readable vaules that we can use throughout the code. Argurments are the values that the we use parameters to make more readable/understandable. Arguments get passed through the functions and parameters give names to that. So to summarize Argmuents = values and parameters = placeholders.
