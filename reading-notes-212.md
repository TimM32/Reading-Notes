- What does the <canvas> allow a developer to acheive?
  Canvas allows admins to create 2 types of developer keys: API keys and LTI keys. API keys allow external applications to act on behalf of an authenticated Canvas user. LTI keys are used to access LTI tools, which standardized externally-hosted tools that users in Canvas can access through an LTI link.
- What is the importance of the closing `</canvas> tag? The <canvas> tag is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via scripting (usually JavaScript). The <canvas> tag is transparent, and is only a container for graphics, you must use a script to actually draw the graphics.
- Explain what the getContext() method does. The getcontext() function initializes the structure pointed to by ucp to the current user context of the calling process. The ucontext_t type that ucp points to defines the user context and includes the contents of the calling process's machine registers, the signal mask, and the current execution stack.

- What is Chart.js and how it can be brought into your project? Chart. js is a popular open-source library for visualizing data.

- List 3 different Chart types you can create using Chart.js.
  Radar Chart, Scatter Chart, or Line Chart

- What are some advantages to displaying data via a chart over a table? Sometimes, data can be better understood when presented by a graph than by a table because the graph can reveal a trend or comparison. Students also find that graphs are easy to use because graphs are made up of lines, dots and blocksâ€”all geometric forms that are simple and quick for students to draw.
- How could Chart.js aid your previously created applications visually? It can take the results and show them in a format that is easier and more organized than just listing the amount of views, likes, clicks in writing one after another. Most people find charts easier and quicker to process than having to go line by line.
