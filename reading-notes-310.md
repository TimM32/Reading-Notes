# Reading Notes Class 310

- What is a ‘call’? In programming, a statement that requests services from another subroutine or program. The call is physically made to the subroutine by a branch instruction or some other linking method that is created by the assembler, compiler or interpreter.
- How many ‘calls’ can happen at once? One at a time and in order.
- What does LIFO mean? The last in, first out, or LIFO (pronounced LIE-foe), accounting method assumes that sellable assets, such as inventory, raw materials, or components, acquired most recently were sold first. The last to be bought is assumed to be the first to be sold using this accounting method
- What causes a Stack Overflow? What causes stack overflow? One of the most common causes of a stack overflow is the recursive function, a type of function that repeatedly calls itself in an attempt to carry out specific logic. Each time the function calls itself, it uses up more of the stack memory.

- What is a ‘reference error’? The ReferenceError object represents an error when a variable that doesn't exist (or hasn't yet been initialized) in the current scope is referenced. ReferenceError is a serializable object, so it can be cloned with structuredClone() or copied between Workers using postMessage()
- What is a ‘syntax error’? Syntax errors are mistakes in the source code, such as spelling and punctuation errors, incorrect labels, and so on, which cause an error message to be generated by the compiler. These appear in a separate error window, with the error type and line number indicated so that it can be corrected in the edit window.
- What is a ‘range error’? A RangeError is thrown when trying to pass a value as an argument to a function that does not allow a range that includes the value. This can be encountered when: passing a value that is not one of the allowed string values to String.
- What is a ‘type error’? The TypeError object represents an error when an operation could not be performed, typically (but not exclusively) when a value is not of the expected type. A TypeError may be thrown when: an operand or argument passed to a function is incompatible with the type expected by that operator or function; or.
- What is a breakpoint? A breakpoint is a point in the program where the code will stop executing. For example, if the programmer amended the logic error in the trace table example they may wish to trigger a break point at line 5 in the algorithm.
- What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code? A debugger is a software tool that can help the software development process by identifying coding errors at various stages of the operating system or application development.
