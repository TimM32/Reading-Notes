# Reading Notes Class 201

-Explain why we need domain modeling. The domain modeling is a very important part of a software design. This model captures the knowledge from the domain, including the main concepts and their relationships.
-Why should tables not be used for page layouts? HTML tables were originally intended to be used for presenting tabular data, not for layout. It is discouraged to use tables for layout because they are striving for a web in which content and structure are completely separate from presentation.

-What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it? Constructor. A constructor can be defined as a special member function which is used to initialize the objects of the class with initial values. It is special member function as its name is the same as the class name. It enables an object to initialize itself during its creation.

-How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor? Objects created using object literal are singletons, this means when a change is made to the object, it affects the object entire the script. Whereas if an object is created using constructor function and a change is made to it, that change won't affect the object throughout the script.
