- Five Differences from SQL and NoSQL:


- What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database? SQL databases are perfectly suited for storing and processing structured data, while NoSQL databases are the best solution for working with unstructured or semi-structured data. If you will manage both structured and unstructured data, you can opt for mixing SQL and NoSQL databases.
- Give a real world example. Since SQL is number based forums you can use this to organize and keep track of how many men or women live ina  city or town.
- What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database? NoSQL databases are often better suited to storing and modeling structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data in one database.
- Give a real world example. Like th example above you can look at attributes of those people, for instance what is their hair color, hieghts, size of families etc.
- Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage? Document based database like MongoDB, and Redis are great for small scale, hierarchical data with a relatively small amount of children for each entry.
- Which type of database is best for scalability? NoSQL is the best kind of database

- What does SQL stand for? Structured Query Language
- What is a relational database? A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another. Relational databases are based on the relational model, an intuitive, straightforward way of representing data in tables.
- What type of structure does a relational database work with? The relational model means that the logical data structures—the data tables, views, and indexes—are separate from the physical storage structures. This separation means that database administrators can manage physical data storage without affecting access to that data as a logical structure.
- What is a ‘schema’? A schema, or scheme, is an abstract concept proposed by J. Piaget to refer to our, well, abstract concepts. Schemas (or schemata) are units of understanding that can be hierarchically categorized as well as webbed into complex relationships with one another. For example, think of a house.
- What is a NoSQL database? NoSQL, also referred to as “not only SQL”, “non-SQL”, is an approach to database design that enables the storage and querying of data outside the traditional structures found in relational databases.
- How does it work?
- What is inside of a MongoDB database?
- Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
- What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
