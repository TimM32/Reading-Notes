# Reading Notes class 210

- Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error. There are generally two types of errors: syntax errors and logic errors. Syntax errors occur when a program does not conform to the grammar of a programming language, and the compiler cannot compile the source file. Logic errors occur when a program does not do what the programmer expects it to do.
- List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them. Al ot fo the errors that I have encountered have either been grammer issues where I forget a ' or I am using a " instead of '. Another issue that I have ran into is trying to have my JS get an Id from somewhere but I have not created that ID so my JS has been confused about where it is suppose to get that. Some of the function stuff was a litte confusing as well, for instances using a or creating a function without actually calling it or identitfying. Simple things that arent hard to change but I just need to keep an eye on. 
- How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

- How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development? The best way that I look at the JS debugger is that it is something that like spellcheck. It looks through all of the code that you are writing and looks for the errors, however unlike spellcheck where it is going to fix the code for you, debugger just lets you know that this code isnt working and here is why. It is up to you to figure out how to fix and make the code work. 
- Define what a breakpoint is. A breakpoint is a point in the program where the code will stop executing. For example, if the programmer amended the logic error in the trace table example they may wish to trigger a break point at line 5 in the algorithm.
- What is the call stack? A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions â€” what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc.
