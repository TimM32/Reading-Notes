- What is Amazon S3? Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service offering industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance.
- Name some use cases for Amazon S3. Customers of all sizes and industries can use Amazon S3 to store and protect any amount of data for a range of use cases, such as data lakes, websites, mobile applications, backup and restore, archive, enterprise applications, IoT devices, and big data analytics.
- Name some benefits of using Amazon S3. Budget-friendly. As we discussed earlier, Amazon provides services based on a pay-as-you-go model.
High scalability. Scalability is the measure to increase or decrease the resource as per need.

- What is AWS Lambda? AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that runs your code in response to events and automatically manages the underlying compute resources for you. These events may include changes in state or an update, such as a user placing an item in a shopping cart on an ecommerce website.

The content they request is first stored on the origin server and is then replicated and stored elsewhere as needed.
- What are the benefits of employing a CDN? Decrease Server Load. Improve Site Speed and Website Performance. Allow Audience Segmentation Based on User Analytics. Reduce Packet Loss and Lower Network Latency. EnableAdvanced Website Security. Enhance Content Availability. Contribute to Cost Savings by Reducing Bandwidth.
