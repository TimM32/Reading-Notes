# Reading Class Notes 208


- Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means. Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout method for arranging items in rows or columns. Items flex (expand) to fill additional space or shrink to fit into smaller spaces. 
- Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis. The cross axis runs perpendicular to the main axis, therefore if your flex-direction (main axis) is set to row or row-reverse the cross axis runs down the columns. If your main axis is column or column-reverse then the cross axis runs along the rows
- How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?

- What are some advantages of using flexbox over float? Instead of using a float to create layouts by floating elements to the left or the right, flexbox allows you to create layouts by aligning items to a single axis. The axis can be horizontal or vertical. It is best used for distributing space for items in the same axis.
- How does this topic connect with your long term goals? This will amke it much mroe efficient for me to know how to use flex box when it comes to designing my webpages. By me being able to adjust and change what I want without affecting everything else, this will make sure that I can design and personalize the webpage.
