# Prep Work Notes 401

## Terminal Practice 
It is important to be comfortable with te terminal because that is where the coding is done! The first time that I started using the terminal a lot I felt out of my depth because I was worried that I would make a mistake or people wouldn't be able to understand what it was that I was trying to do. I also felt a bit overwhelmed with all the commands there, but after reading the article and others similar to it I have found myself really enjoying it and finding new commands and methods. 

## Growth Mindset
You have to be able to look a yourself first and see where it is you can grow as a persons much less a devolper. Having gone through 201 and 301 previously and doing project weeks, labs, and other group assignments it is important to under which strength you bring to a project but more importantly what weakness you have so that you know where you need to focus your efforts on to be a better team memeber. In the past I use it play rugby professionally, so I am very use to high pressure situation with people. You had to be able to commuicate what was going on and allow your teammates the opportunity to help you and the team succeed. It all comes back to respect and patience so that everyone feels they can be their best self, which in return will help me become my best self as a devloper. 

## SQL Introduction
SQL is a declarative programming language designed to store, retrieve, manage or manipulate data within a Relational Database Management System. Since databases can hold as much or as little information as required, having a fuss-free data analysis system is an absolute must.

I found this section very interesting and I am looking forward to exploring SQL more, I am going to be looking for some more information on it and practice it more. Really cool stuff

## Data and Algorithms
- What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem? It is important to state that no single data structure serves as an optimal solution for all problems. With that in mind, to pick the best data structure to solve a particular problem, we have to take into account what are the operations we are going to perform and how often they are going to be executed.

- How can we ensure that we’ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack? Infinite recursion is avoided by ensure that progress is made toward the basis case or cases in every recursive call. While many recursive functions are easily rewritten to remove the recursion, some advanced problems are difficult to solve without recursion.

## Engineer
- What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can? I have lived in a few different countries over the years and have been fortunate enough to have traveled around the world due to rugby. I feel that I bring a good perspective of how other countries live and interact with each other, the things that they do well and not well. I have also had to work with an array of different people from all walks of life, so I am pretty use to getting to know people and doing my best to allow them to feel safe and welcomed when trying to work together.

- What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature? The first one is that I will get up and walk away, take a little break so that I can reset not jsut my brain but also my eyes. Google, google, google. I have been using resources like StackOverflow to help me understand a method or function better so that I can solve whatever issue I might be having. Lastly, asking for help from a student, TA, or the teacher. After all we are all in this together to learn and get better at coding!
