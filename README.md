## My Growth Mindest
  A growth mindset is the perspective you have in any given situation in life. In this instance we are talking about the way we can use a positive outlook when it comes to learning. Some people might have what is called a fixed mindset. Where they look at challenges, criticism, or success of others as threats or obstacles. This might set gets in the way of learning and finding your passion for it. Taking on challeneges and putting the advice/criticism of others to good use is fundamental in achieving your goals and reaching your full potential.
  
### Growth Mindset Reminders
  Here are 3 reminders to help keep the right mindset:
    
    1. Always have an open mind to ideas, advice, failures, and challenges. This is will help you allow yourself to undetstand where you might need help, what you are doing well, and how you might be able to do things better/more efficiently.
    
    2. Take any challenge that presents itself one step at a time. If you try to conquer a challenge all at once you may find it insurmountable, but if you break it down into smaller types and slowly work away at it those small victories will build up into overcoming the obstacle in your way.
   
    3. Most things in life worth doing takes effort. Sometimes the effort you put in may not produce the results you want right away, but knowing that this effort is not wasted and is helping to build towards the results you want is key in managing realistic gaols and frustrations.
