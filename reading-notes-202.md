# Reading Notes Class 02

This was a pretty interesting read and is definitely something that I am going to have to read again. It is pretty important because it really starts to get into all the different things that CSS can do for your webpage or project. I find that this is something that right now, is taking me the longest to figure out just because I don't have it ingrained into my mind like I do some of the other things that we are going into, like js. 

I do have a few questions...I know that I can design the home page one way, but I am curious how I would go about change maybe a contacts page or about me page. Do I need to make a seperate css style sheet for that or am I able to just design it within the style sheet that I have already for the main page.
