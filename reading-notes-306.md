# Reading Notes Class 306

- Who is Roy Fielding? He is one of the creators of HTTP
- Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world? That is because we are not learning machine language. Machine langauge is binary or 1s and 0s. We are learning a type of langauge that other software devs will be able to read and understand. 
- What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created? It is all about applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.
- What does a GET do? The GET method refers to a HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) method that is applied while requesting information from a particular source. It is also used to get a specific variable derived from a group. The HTTP POST asks for input of information from the supplying browser into the server's message system.
- What does a POST do? The Power-On Self-Test process verifies the viability of the hardware necessary to run a computer's OS and applications properly.
- What does PUT do? What does the PUT method do? # The PUT method completely replaces whatever currently exists at the target URL with something else. With this method, you can create a new resource or overwrite an existing one given you know the exact Request-URI.
- What does PATCH do? In computing, the PATCH method is a request method in HTTP for making partial changes to an existing resource. The PATCH method provides an entity containing a list of changes to be applied to the resource requested using the HTTP Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).
