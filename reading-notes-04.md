# Reading Notes Class 4


1. What is HTML and why do we use it? It is a markup laungauge that tells the browser what the content is, it incudes the text, headlines, images and links. We use HTML to full out and make up what a user sees on the front end of a web page. We use this to in order to create and maintain the information on any given webpage. There are other tools and elements we can use to make this process faster. 
2. What are the 3 main parts of an HTML element? You have an opening tag (< p>), a closing tag (< /p>), and then the cotents that fill between the two tags. So, you should have a format that looks like this when you are done;  < p> Contents (tests, links, etc.) < /p>. 
3. What is it called when you give an element extra information? This is called Nesting, which refers to putting an element with another element. For example, ig you want to empahaised a certain characteristic of a word, you can make that word bold, bigger etc. This requires nesting another element or adding more information into that element to create the desired affect. 
4. What is a semantic element?


## Additional Information

Found it interesting that if you looking at wirefarming in the sense that it is a blank piece of paper and you have to create a roadmap for someone to follow, it doesnt matter what color it is or the graphics you might have if they can't follow your roadmap. Obviously, we all want to make our webistes or projects looks nice, vibrant and iniviting but if that gets in the way of its fundamental job. 

Clarity, Confidence and Simplicity are the key in making a good wire frame and for that matter making a project you will be working on!
