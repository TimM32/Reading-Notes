# Reading Notes Class 3

Git is a univerisal tool used for backing up, cloning, changing, and sharing code. The reason that git has gained so much popularity is that it allows you to use work on coding at the same time as multipe people.These means more work can be done in less time. Something else that is very handy about github is that it snapshots every change you make. Meaning, that whenever you change any line of code it will create a seperate file that you can go into later and see what you were working on at that time, what the project looked like at the time. This is a very useful tool because it will last the span of a projects life, so if there is ever an issue where you need to go back and compare what the code or project looked like at a previous time, you have periodic moments in the projects life to go back to and look at.
