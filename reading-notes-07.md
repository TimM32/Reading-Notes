# Reading Notes Class 7

1. What is control flow? Control flow is the order in which the computer is going to execute the statements in a  script. Another way to look at it, is that the control flow are the instructions that your computer is going to follow. The more percise this are the better the execution will be. 
2. What is a JavaScript function? A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).
3. What does it mean to invoke - or call - a function? Defining a function does not execute it. Defining it names the function and specifies what to do when the function is called. Calling the function actually performs the specified actions with the indicated parameters. 
4. What are the parenthesis () for when you define a function? The lines and information that goes inside the parenthesis is the action that is going to be executed by the computer through JavaScript. 

## Additional Information/Questions

I am very curious to see much JavaScript can impact the rest of coding. Been getting through the CSS and seeing how much that impacts a HTML or webpages.
