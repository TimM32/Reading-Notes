- What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming? EventEmitter. Node. js natively provides us with a useful module called EventEmitter that allows us to get started incorporating Event-Driven Programming in our project right away.
- What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming? Object oriented programming focuses on performing actions and manipulation of data that is encapsulated in objects within a sequential series of steps while event driven is more dynamic and relies on event triggering and event handling to determine the sequencing of the program.
- Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js. Event driven programming is something that you use all the time. It can give you alerts about when you have an unread email, new messages, or someone trying to access your account etc. Without this type of programming you will have to continue to check your device in order to see if anything has updated or if there is any issues going on. The quality of life this brings is almost immeasurable.
