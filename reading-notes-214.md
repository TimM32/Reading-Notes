# Pstcohological Safety

- What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?
- Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety. 
    Playing a professional sport is a really high stress environment when you are bringing in the factor that people are trying to make a living, but due to the nature of the sport there is no guarantee that you are going to be around for the whole year let alone your career. You can either be cut or traded. 
   I woulnt say that it was an unsafe place to work nor would I say it brought out the bad sides of people, but more that it required you to have to manage your stress and both your mental and physical well being. A lot of life happens in the top two inches as we put it in the sports world.
- What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?
