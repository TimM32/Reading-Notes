# Reading Notes Class 6

1. What are variables in JavaScript? A JavaScript variable is simply a name of storage location. There are two types of variables in JavaScript : local variable and global variable. There are some rules while declaring a JavaScript variable (also known as identifiers). Name must start with a letter (a to z or A to Z), underscore( _ ), or dollar( $ ) sign.
2. What does it mean to declare a variable? You declare a variable to specify its name and characteristics. The declaration statement for variables is the Dim Statement. Its location and contents determine the variable's characteristics.
3. What is an “assignment” operator, and what does it do? With in JavaScript an assignment refers to the value of its right-hand operand to a variable, a property, or an indexer element given by its left-hand operand. The result of an assignment expression is the value assigned to the left-hand operand. In JavaScript = is the assoignment. 
4. What is information received from the user called? This is called the prompt within JavaScript

## Additional Information 

The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

- Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
- Names must begin with a letter.
- Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial).
- Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).
- Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.
