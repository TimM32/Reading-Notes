# Reading Notes Class 33

- What is Role Based Access Control (RBAC)?  Access control based on user roles (i.e., a collection of access authorizations a user receives based on an explicit or implicit assumption of a given role).
- Share an example of RBAC including all possible CRUD operations and correlating roles. Users can also be assigned temporary access to certain data or programs to complete a task and be removed after. Common examples of RBAC include: Software engineering role: Has access to GCP, AWS, and GitHub. Marketing role: Has access to HubSpot, Google Analytics, Facebook Ads, and Google Ads.
- What are the Benefits of RBAC? Improved operational efficiency. With RBAC, companies can decrease the need for paperwork and password changes when they hire new employees or switch the roles of existing employees. Enhanced compliance.

- Describe some react-cookie features. This lets you deal with cookies from browers and edit them to fit what your needs are. You can set timeframe, add, edit, or delete them within the react app.It help to create hooks to manage those cookies in a react friendly way.
- Describe some react-cookies features. It is a smaller library that doesn"t have to work with outside sources as much as the one above and it is much more straightforward. It is also more lightweight than the other one above which is why more people prefer it.
- Which library would you prefer would you prefer? Why? Hard for me to answer this questions because I havent used either one and although react-cookies seems to be easier than react-cookie that may not be the case when I actually start looking into using them. I think I would be leaning more to react-cookies because it is lightweight and more straight forward but I can see why people would use the react-cookie instead.
